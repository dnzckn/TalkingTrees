      "description": "CRITICAL BUG FIX: All clipboard operations (copy, cut, paste, duplicate) were only working with single selectedNode instead of selectedNodes Set. Fixed all functions to properly handle multi-select. Copy/paste now supports copying/pasting multiple nodes at once. Duplicate creates offset copies of all selected nodes.

Added better padding calculation (20% margin around tree bounds). Implemented scale clamping to prevent extreme zoom levels (0.1x to 10x range). Ensures smooth and safe zoom-to-fit behavior even with edge cases.",

      "description": "CRITICAL BUG FIX: Canvas had hardcoded dimensions (4000x3000) but was displayed in smaller flex container. This caused ALL viewport calculations (fit, minimap, search navigation) to use wrong canvas.width/height values, making them pan to incorrect locations. Added resizeCanvas() function that dynamically sets canvas dimensions to match container on load and window resize. This single fix resolves all reported viewport bugs.",
